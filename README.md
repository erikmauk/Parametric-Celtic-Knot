# Parametric-Celtic-Knot
Computational Art: Lab 5 (Animation with Parametric Curves)

In this lab, I used a parametric equation to generate this celtic knot.

There are a plethera of different shapes that can be made from even changing one of the equations constants by .1.
Since I am a huge fan of satisfying patterns, this lab was very enjoyable for me. Another interesting part of this lab
is that if it is allowed to go on forever, with the gradient-looking color, the celtic knot looks like a cool loading screen.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video of the final product attached. Enjoy!
